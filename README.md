# FEPrepare
One of the most important tasks in drug design is to predict, among a series of lead candidates, which ones will bind more strongly to the therapeutic target. In this direction, relative binding free energy methodologies have been developed, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and rigorous statistical mechanics to calculate the differences in the free energy of binding between a parent candidate drug and analogues. For example, Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) calculations calculate the free energy difference between an initial (reference) and a final (target) molecule to an average of a function of their energy difference evaluated by sampling for the initial state. Automating free energy perturbation calculations is a step forward to delivering high throughput calculations for accurate predictions of relative binding affinities before a compound is synthesized, and consequently save enormous time and cost. NAMD is a free parallel molecular dynamics code, designed for high-performance simulations of large biomolecular systems. Although FEP calculations are possible with NAMD, no automated tool has been developed to streamline the process, making the calculations tedious and unfeasible for a large number of molecules. That gave us the motivation to provide an easily accessible web based preparation tool which can produce all the files needed to run a NAMD simulation.
